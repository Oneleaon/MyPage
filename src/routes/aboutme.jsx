          Hello, I'm Alexis. I started programming at 15 learning the basics with Visual Basic followed by Java, which would be the language I used for my first big project.
          My friend and I were able to recreate a chess board with all the pieces moving as they should. The was no ai, so it was always a two player game. Unless you have fun playing chess against yourself.
          We also made a silly game mode where once you take a piece from your opponent, a random piece spawns onto your side in your colour.
